    <p>
      In this section, we outline the methods used to collect raw data about Falcon 9 rocket launches.
      Two main sources were used:
    </p>

    <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
      <li>
        <strong>SpaceX REST API:</strong> Provides structured JSON data on past launches, including payloads,
        rocket IDs, landing outcomes, and more.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Wikipedia:</strong> Specific tables were scraped using BeautifulSoup to enrich the dataset with
        additional contextual information such as mission names and outcomes.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The collected data includes technical and mission-specific information which was later cleaned and normalized
      to build a high-quality dataset ready for analysis and modeling.
    </p>

      <p class="font-semibold mb-2">Tools used:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6">
        <li><code>requests</code> – To access and retrieve data from the SpaceX API</li>
        <li><code>pandas</code> – For data wrangling and normalization</li>
        <li><code>BeautifulSoup</code> – For scraping HTML tables from Wikipedia</li>
        <li><code>json_normalize</code> – To flatten nested JSON structures into tabular format</li>
