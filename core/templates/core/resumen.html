    <p>
      This project is part of the IBM Data Science course and simulates a real-world scenario:
      working as a data scientist in a company called <strong>SpaceY</strong>,
      which aims to compete with <strong>SpaceX</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The main objective is to analyze public launch data from SpaceX,
      extracted from its <strong>official REST API</strong> and other sources, to predict
      whether the <strong>first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket will be reused</strong> in a given launch.
    </p>

    <p>
      This will allow SpaceY to estimate launch costs and make strategic decisions
      to reduce expenses and improve competitiveness in the aerospace market.
