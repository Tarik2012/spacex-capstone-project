      This interactive map displays the geographical locations of the main SpaceX launch sites used for Falcon 9 missions.
      It has been designed to provide a clear, visual understanding of where launches take place across the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each marker corresponds to an official launch site. By clicking on a marker, you can view its name and location.
      The map automatically adjusts the zoom to ensure all sites are visible, allowing you to explore each location in detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Understanding the distribution and proximity of launch sites is a key part of the exploratory data analysis in this project,
      helping to identify patterns and factors that may influence launch success rates.
